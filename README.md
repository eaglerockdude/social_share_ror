### Summary :

This is a quick Rails application that demos the 'social-share-button' Gem

The base of the example is from the [Rich on Rails Blog](http://richonrails.com/) blog which I think has some good stuff.

Example code using the gem 'social-share-button', '~> 0.1.6'

Include social buttons without 3rd party overhead and tracking.
